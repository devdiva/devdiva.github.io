=================

devdiva's devblog.

# Toolchain

For now, I am using middleman.  I looked at jekyll and nanoc, but rather than spend lots 
(more) time debating the merits of each... I chose middleman.

# Editorial Goals

To-be-clarified.  I'm inclined towards a narrow focus on development for the devblog, but 
I do have a broader set of interests.  

* Retrospective - Looking backward, to look forward...
* Security Matters - Pulling my head out of the sand...
* Test Driven Development
  * For Ruby
  * For JavaScript
  * For CSS and UI?
* Interactive stuff
* 

# Editorial Workflow

Just write.

I don't want to get hung up on fine-tuning and wordsmithing.  So, the editorial workflow
I am attempting should emphasize "continuous delivery" but also allow for the kind of 
polishing and professionalism I think is important in the long run.

* Rough drafts are committed to and visible in the develop branch
* Drafts first, second, third ... final are published with clear dates and "versioning"
  
# Git Workflow

Initially pretty basic, but may get more complex as needed.

* master - the published pages
* source - the static site app
