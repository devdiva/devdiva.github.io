## About DEVDIVA

DEVDIVA started in 1999 as an aspirational moniker. I've grown with the web over the years, graduating from brochureware to web applications to social networking sites to services-based application ecosystems. DEVDIVA is my ever-evolving personal and professional site.

## About Me

I am a technology consultant in San Francisco, CA.

Previous projects include work for Fortune 500 companies, social networking startups, charitable organizations, network service providers, email marketing and interactive design agencies.

## Consulting

I do a spot of consulting from time-to-time. Typical engagements are for information architecture, web site design, development and deployment.
