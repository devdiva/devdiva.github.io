# Draft: Finally, a devdiva devblog

Because, I know you all have been waiting with baited breath.  

Seriously, my purpose in starting this devblog is to help me to articulate thoughts about 
my (a)vocation.  Incidentally, if I'm lucky, I may also help you in your knowledge 
acquisition.  That's a lot of words to say... Here's what I've learned and here's what I'm 
learning. You know? You like?  READMORE

<span class="moniker">devdiva</span> started in 1999 as an aspirational moniker.  I had
some vague notion of what I wanted to learn, who I wanted to be and how I wanted to 
present myself.  From those early days of barely hacking it with HTML, knowing a dash of 
Lingo and nascent CSS... I've grown with the web, graduating from brochureware to web 
applications to social networking sites and beyond.

These days I might be called an "interaction" designer or an "interactive" or "full-stack" 
developer.  Practically, speaking this means during the day I'm as likely to be found 
creating apps and things with ActionScript, CSS, Flash, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, 
Ruby on Rails, SQL and XML. I may also be found designing solutions, information 
architectures, web sites, creating infographics and trying my hand at data visualization.  

<span class="moniker">devdiva</span> sometimes feels like the echo of a younger, more 
flamboyant me... but it still embodies the kind of passion, breadth of knowledge and style 
I want to make my own.  So, here I go into the next demi-decade ...
