    "text": "Summary\nAnnounced a year ago, Quarto is a pretty tidy publishing system and the evolution of R Markdown. Billed as “an open-source scientific and technical publishing system”, Quarto allows authors to write in Pandoc markdown and publish to multiple document formats. Further, it’s not just for R!\nI’ve been transitioning my personal notebooks to Quarto and have found the paradigm shift to a publishing system matches my workflow pretty nicely. So much so, that I am trying it out here for authoring and publishing as static website.\nOut-of-the-box support for creating data notebooks, dynamic content and diagrams mean very little setup for most use cases. Another really nice aspect is support for multiple authoring tools including R Studio, VS Code, Neovim or any text editor via the CLI.\nSo far, Quarto is really speaking to my polyglot needs. And where it does not, custom extensions offer a path to further tailor the experience and rendering outputs."
