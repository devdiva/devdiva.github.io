A nice (newish) option for data notebooks and technical publishing.  

**DRAFT**

## Summary

Announced a year ago, Quarto is a pretty tidy publishing system and the evolution of R Markdown.
Billed as "an open-source scientific and technical publishing system", Quarto allows authors to
write in Pandoc markdown and publish to multiple document formats.  Further, it's not just for R!

I've been transitioning my personal notebooks to Quarto and have found the paradigm shift to a
publishing system matches my workflow pretty nicely.  So much so, that I am tyring it out here
for authoring and publishing as static website.

Out-of-the-box support for creating data notebooks, dynamic content and diagrams mean very little
setup for most use cases.  Another really nice aspect is support for multiple authoring tools
including R Studio, VS Code, Neovim or any text editor via the CLI. 

So far, Quarto is really speaking to my polyglot needs.  And where it does not, custom extensions
offer a path to further tailor the experience and rendering outputs.

## Overview

### Tools

I've not yet found the one tool to rule them all (pretty sure it doesn't exist). 
Quarto's multi-tool support let's me choose based on what helps me best to focus
or in the context of the type of content.  

I've had good experiences so far in the following tools:

* CLI
* Neovim
* VS Code
* R Studio

For this site, I've mostly been using VS Code or the CLI.  For my various management
data workbooks I've been using R Studio.


### Authoring

Write in markdown comfortably using tool of preference.  For this site, I've mostly been using VS Code and a CLI.  For my personal p

### Outputs & Rendering

<!-- A wide varity of rendering options based on established/stable tech (Pandoc, R Markdown, Knittr).
Interesting options for publishing to wiki's and extension system for customization

- documents like pdf, epub, doc
- html (as a website, a reveljs presentation, etc.)
- markdown (some magic here.) -->

### Publishing

#### Web::Blog

Publishing manually or via Github Actions for a PR-based workflow is pretty simple.

### Projects


## Wishlist

Things to find how to do or customize later.

* Metadata
  - Custom metadata display in articles
    - `status` I'd like to be able to create status metadata that can be displayed on page
* Custom templates and starters
* Boostrap is a very good default, but I'd like to have more options to customize
  - Current custom theming still has bootstrap to override
  - Bootstrap template bugs
    - Search icon / menu placement, menu open jitter
* CLI command to easily create new posts or pages
* Code execution or playgrounds, more immediate wishes are for
  - JavaScript
  - Typescript
  - Rust, Wasm
  - Web graphics (or codepen embeds?)
* Global dictionary/constants for categories and keywords
* VSCode markdown formatter (break at char limits or other linting)

## Errata

* [Quarto litmus test](/notes/quarto/){target="_blank"} to try syntax and features
