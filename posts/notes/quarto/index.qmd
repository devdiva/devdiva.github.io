A nice (newish) option for data notebooks and technical publishing.  

Announced a year ago, Quarto is a pretty tidy publishing system and the evolution of R Markdown. 

> An open-source scientific and technical publishing system

Markdown (qmd)

- Mermaid
- Graphviz
- R
- Python
- Observable JS

Code block rendering

<!-- TODO code block overrides working with ojs? -->

```{ojs}
window.alert('hi');
```

```html
<a href="#">foo</a>
```

```css
.foo { 
  color: "#000";
  width: 100px;
}
```

A wide varity of rendering options based on established/stable tech (Pandoc, R Markdown, Knittr).
Interesting options for publishing to wiki's and extension system for customization

- documents like pdf, epub, doc
- html (as a website, a reveljs presentation, etc.)
- markdown (some magic here.)

A fairly simple to setup Github Pages and Github Actions workflow.
